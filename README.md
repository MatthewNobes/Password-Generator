# Password-Generator

A simple password generator application. It provides a recommended random passwords based upon a user requirements for the password. The original version is a C#, .NET Framework based Windows Form Application. This branch contains the new JS React version of the application, currently under development. 

## Plan 

The current plan for this project is to create an app that generates a complex password of 12 characters, made up of numbers, letters (capitals and lowercase) and symbols. In future, the user will be allowed to customise elements of their password, such as choosing what types of characters can be selected, the password length and characters to avoid.
